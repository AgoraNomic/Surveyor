Agora owns at least one Estate. As such, it is my honour to begin the =
auction for the Estate of Antegria. Bids may be placed by announcement =
to the public forum as described in Rule 2491.

All players are eligible to place bids on their own behalf. All players =
are eligible to place bids on behalf of an Organization if it is =
Appropriate under that Organization=E2=80=99s charter.

Don=E2=80=99t forget, I=E2=80=99ve pledged to run a writing competition =
during this auction:

> If elected Surveyor, then, during the June estate auction - during =
which i will auction off Antegria - I will additionally accept short, =
tourist-centric, blurbs about Antegria alongside bids. These blurbs =
should talk about the history and geography of the region of Antegria, =
and pitch it to hypothetical tourists who might want to visit that =
region.
>=20
> If the winning bid includes a blurb of at least 70 words, I pledge to =
kick in 10% of the winning bid, rounded up, up to a maximum of 50 =
shinies, by paying the winner that amount from my own balance immedately =
after resolving the auction.
>=20
> These blurbs will be included, for flavour, in the Surveyor=E2=80=99s =
weekly report.


I=E2=80=99m looking forwards to your submissions!
