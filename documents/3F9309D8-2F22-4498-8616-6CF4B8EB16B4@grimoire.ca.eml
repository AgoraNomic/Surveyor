sites in its borders. Although known primarily for its many open-air =
sulphur lakes and the occasional volcanic eruption, Antegria is a land =
of endless natural beauty with over three national parks dedicated to =
some of the most unique landscapes of the world, such as Antegria's =
famed desert of glass, pristine lava flats, and wide expansive heaths. A =
trip through fetid Antegria is not complete without spotting two of the =
most iconic animals inhabiting the region: the Moorlands Dire Alpaca and =
the Antegrian Fire Keese, both of which should be easy to find on any =
day trip from the capital, St. Marmero.

> For the culturally-inclined visitor, the Presidential Palace Square in =
downtown St. Marmero is an iconic location, and, with the completion of =
the new statue commemorating the crowning of the Princess of Agora, now =
an even more paramount destination to be visiting. Down the street from =
the palace is the Antegrian War Memorial, showing the struggles and =
triumphs of our countrymen in the many wars this region had been =
embroiled in. =46rom visiting the noteworthy battlefields of yore to a =
gastronomical adventure across the countryside, the Ministry of Tourism =
offers a variety of tours, with complementary professional tour guides =
and security for the trip. If a regimented schedule is not your thing, =
heading out and forging your own path in Antegria is always an =
adventure: you may even find some hidden gems in the countryside!
