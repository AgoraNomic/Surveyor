I retract any previous "bid" I made on the Estate of Antegria.

I bid 50 Shinies on the estate of Antegria, and submit the below-quoted
text as the blurb (it's identical to the original):

{{
Anomic Antegria is a picturesque pastoral region with many historic sites
in its borders. Although known primarily for its many open-air sulphur
lakes and the occasional volcanic eruption, Antegria is a land of endless
natural beauty with over three national parks dedicated to some of the most
unique landscapes of the world, such as Antegria's famed desert of glass,
pristine lava flats, and wide expansive heaths. A trip through fetid
Antegria is not complete without spotting two of the most iconic animals
inhabiting the region: the Moorlands Dire Alpaca and the Antegrian Fire
Keese, both of which should be easy to find on any day trip from the
capital, St. Marmero.

For the culturally-inclined visitor, the Presidential Palace Square in
downtown St. Marmero is an iconic location, and, with the completion of the
new statue commemorating the crowning of the Princess of Agora, now an even
more paramount destination to be visiting. Down the street from the palace
is the Antegrian War Memorial, showing the struggles and triumphs of our
countrymen in the many wars this region had been embroiled in. From
visiting the noteworthy battlefields of yore to a gastronomical adventure
across the countryside, the Ministry of Tourism offers a variety of tours,
with complementary professional tour guides and security for the trip. If a
regimented schedule is not your thing, heading out and forging your own
path in Antegria is always an adventure: you may even find some hidden gems
in the countryside!
