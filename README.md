# Agora Land Records Archive

Welcome to the Agora Land Records Archive. This archive records changes to Estates - entities defined in the rules of Agora that operate much like real estate.

This archive operates in three parts.

## Documents

The `documents` directory contains unaltered copies of original documents. For the most part, these are complete emails, including headers, as delivered. They are filed using a document-specific unique identifier:

* Documents originating as email are named for their Message-ID, with the suffix `.eml`.

To file a new document:

1. Drop the original, under any name with the correct suffix, in the `documents` directory.

2. Run `bin/file-document <path to document>` using the file-document script in this repository. This will canonicalize the document's name, or abort if a document with the same canonical name already exists.

## Estates

The `estates` directory contains one directory per Estate, as defined by the rules, documenting the history of that Estate. Each event is recorded as a subdirectory, whose name is the ISO 8601 timestamp of the event. The following files exist in each event directory:

* `document` is a symbolic link to the original document in the `documents` directory.

* `event.yaml` is a YAML file containing two keys:

    * The `event` key, describing the event. This presently contains a single key, `summary`, containing a one-line prose description of the event.

    * The `diff` key, describing the changes to the state of the Estate's properties. This is a YAML encoding of an RFC 6902 JSON Patch object, which can be applied in sequence to build a YAML representation of the Estate.

    Interpretation of the diff key is modified from the RFC. Any key which is not otherwise defined by some sequence of patch actions is presumed to be equal to an empty object when first accessed by a patch. This allows disjoint sequences of patches to be coalesced into a single patch sequence without having to worry about the specific interleaving order on "uninteresting" keys (those which are objects that contain only objects, and exist solely to organize the data).

All timestamps are in UTC.

The YAML representation of an estate describes its properties at a specific point in time. It can be computed by starting with an empty YAML document and applying the diff section, as a JSON Patch document, of each event, in chronological order. The resulting object has, at present, the following important keys:

* `full_name`, giving the full formal name of the Estate, and

* `short_name`, giving the short name of the Estate, and

* `owner`, naming the entity which owns the Estate.

* `description`, a prose description of the Estate, from the bidding contest.

Other keys are permitted, but ignored by the reporting tools.

To create a new event from a document:

1. File the document.

2. Run `bin/link-event <path to document> <path to estate>`. If the timestamp cannot be detected, or needs to be overridden, use the `--timestamp` option with an ISO 8601 timestamp.

3. Edit the resulting YAML file.

## Reports

The `reports` directory contains subdirectories for each report required by the rules for the office of Surveyor. The contents of these directories are date-stamped report editions, as plain text, plus an optional draft of the next report that will be sent.

For the office of Surveyor, _all_ reports are generated from the data in the `estates` and `documents` directory programmatically. Tweaks may be applied before transmission but should be kept to a bare minimum.

## Automation

Much of the work of operating this archive is handled by a set of Python programs contained in this repository. To run them, you will need:

* A Python 3 installation (version 3.6.0 or later).

To set them up, or to install updated dependencies:

1. Create and activate a virtualenv:

        python3.6 -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install libraries:

        pip install -r requirements.txt

3. You're done!

The programs are contained in the `bin` directory, and respond with basic usage information when invoked as `PROGRAM --help`.

To add new libraries:

1. Install them in the virtualenv:

        pip install NAME

2. Update `requirements.txt`:

        pip freeze > requirements.txt
