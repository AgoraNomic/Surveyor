===== The Estate of Antegria =====
Owner: 天火狐

Anomic Antegria is a picturesque pastoral region with many historic
sites in its borders. Although known primarily for its many open-air
sulphur lakes and the occasional volcanic eruption, Antegria is a land
of endless natural beauty with over three national parks dedicated to
some of the most unique landscapes of the world, such as Antegria's
famed desert of glass, pristine lava flats, and wide expansive heaths.
A trip through fetid Antegria is not complete without spotting two of
the most iconic animals inhabiting the region: the Moorlands Dire
Alpaca and the Antegrian Fire Keese, both of which should be easy to
find on any day trip from the capital, St. Marmero.

For the culturally-inclined visitor, the Presidential Palace Square in
downtown St. Marmero is an iconic location, and, with the completion of
the new statue commemorating the crowning of the Princess of Agora, now
an even more paramount destination to be visiting. Down the street from
the palace is the Antegrian War Memorial, showing the struggles and
triumphs of our countrymen in the many wars this region had been
embroiled in. From visiting the noteworthy battlefields of yore to a
gastronomical adventure across the countryside, the Ministry of Tourism
offers a variety of tours, with complementary professional tour guides
and security for the trip. If a regimented schedule is not your thing,
heading out and forging your own path in Antegria is always an
adventure: you may even find some hidden gems in the countryside!
