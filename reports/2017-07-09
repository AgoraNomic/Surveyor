===== The Estate of Antegria =====
Owner: 天火狐

    Anomic Antegria is a picturesque pastoral region with many
    historic sites in its borders. Although known primarily for its
    many open-air sulphur lakes and the occasional volcanic eruption,
    Antegria is a land of endless natural beauty with over three
    national parks dedicated to some of the most unique landscapes of
    the world, such as Antegria's famed desert of glass, pristine lava
    flats, and wide expansive heaths. A trip through fetid Antegria is
    not complete without spotting two of the most iconic animals
    inhabiting the region: the Moorlands Dire Alpaca and the Antegrian
    Fire Keese, both of which should be easy to find on any day trip
    from the capital, St. Marmero.

    For the culturally-inclined visitor, the Presidential Palace
    Square in downtown St. Marmero is an iconic location, and, with
    the completion of the new statue commemorating the crowning of the
    Princess of Agora, now an even more paramount destination to be
    visiting. Down the street from the palace is the Antegrian War
    Memorial, showing the struggles and triumphs of our countrymen in
    the many wars this region had been embroiled in. From visiting the
    noteworthy battlefields of yore to a gastronomical adventure
    across the countryside, the Ministry of Tourism offers a variety
    of tours, with complementary professional tour guides and security
    for the trip. If a regimented schedule is not your thing, heading
    out and forging your own path in Antegria is always an adventure:
    you may even find some hidden gems in the countryside!
